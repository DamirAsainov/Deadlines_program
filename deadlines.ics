	ode thoroughly to make sure it works as expected. Test it with different in
	puts and edge cases to ensure it is robust.\n\n	*\nInitialize a new Git rep
	ository: In IntelliJ IDEA\, select "VCS" from the menu and choose "Import i
	nto Version Control" > "Create Git repository". This will initialize a new 
	Git repository in your project folder.\n\n	*\nAdd your code to Git: Once yo
	u have initialized your Git repository\, you can add your code to it. In In
	telliJ IDEA\, select the files you want to add and choose "Add to Git".\n\n
		*\nCommit your changes: Once you have added your code to Git\, you can com

	menu and choose "Git" > "Push". Enter your GitHub credentials if prompted.\
	n\nTASK EVALUATION:\nThe task at hand involves using GitHub\, committing mo
	re than 10 times\, documenting code\, and a final defense. The evaluation f
	or this task will be based on the following criteria:\n\n	*\nGITHUB USAGE (
	10%): The usage of GitHub will be evaluated based on how well the user is a
	ble to use GitHub for version control.\n\n	*\nCOMMITS (20%): The user will 
	be evaluated based on the number of commits made to the project. A minimum 
	of 10 commits is required to receive any points in this category. However\,
	 the quality and relevance of the commits will also be evaluated. Commits s
	hould be made at regular intervals and should reflect significant changes i
	n the code.\n\n	*\nDOCUMENTING CODE (20%): The user will be evaluated on th
	eir ability to document their code. Documentation should include comments i
	n the code\, a README file\, and any other relevant documentation. The docu
	mentation should be clear\, concise\, and easy to understand.\n\n	*\nDEFENS
	E (50%): The final defense will be evaluated based on the user's ability to
	 explain their code\, their design decisions\, and any challenges they face
	d. The user should demonstrate a thorough understanding of the project and 
	be able to answer questions from the evaluation committee. The user's abili
	ty to defend their work will be a crucial factor in the final evaluation.\n

SUMMARY:Assignment 2 is due
DESCRIPTION:You need to create classes MyArrayList and MyLinkedList which a
	re implementations of ArrayList and LinkedList respectively.\n\nYOU ARE NOT
	 ALLOWED TO USE JAVA.UTIL.ARRAYLIST AND JAVA.UTIL.LINKEDLIST!\n\nBoth of cl
	asses should implement an interface MyList\n\nMyArrayList:\n\n	* Create a n
	ew class called MyArrayList that implements the List interface.\n	* Define 
	a private instance variable of type Object[] to hold the elements of the li
	st.\n	* Define an int variable called size to keep track of the number of e
	lements in the list.\n	* Implement the add(E element) method by first check
	ing if the size of the array is large enough to accommodate the new element
	. If it is not\, create a new array with double the size of the original ar
	ray\, copy over the elements from the original array\, and then add the new
	 element. Otherwise\, simply add the new element to the end of the array an
	d increment the size variable.\n	* Implement the get(int index) method by r
	eturning the element at the specified index.\n	* Implement the remove(int i
	ndex) method by removing the element at the specified index\, shifting all 
	subsequent elements to the left by one position\, and decrementing the size
	 variable.\n	* Implement the size() method by returning the size variable.\
	n	* Implement any other methods specified by the List interface.\n	* Test a
	ll methods of MyArrayList\n\nMyLinkedList:\n\n	* Create a new class called 
	MyLinkedList that implements the List interface.\n	* Define a private inner
	 class called Node that contains an element of type E and references to the
	 next and previous nodes in the list.\n	* Define a private instance variabl
	e called head that references the first node in the list.\n	* Define a priv
	ate instance variable called tail that references the last node in the list
	.\n	* Define an int variable called size to keep track of the number of ele
	ments in the list.\n	* Implement the add(E element) method by creating a ne
	w Node with the specified element\, setting its next reference to null (sin
	ce it will be the new tail)\, and its previous reference to the current tai
	l. If the list is empty\, set both the head and tail references to the new 
	node. Otherwise\, set the next reference of the current tail to the new nod
	e and update the tail reference to the new node. Finally\, increment the si
	ze variable.\n	* Implement the get(int index) method by traversing the list
	 from the head (or tail\, depending on which is closer to the specified ind
	ex) and returning the element at the specified index.\n	* Implement the rem
	ove(int index) method by first traversing the list to the node at the speci
	fied index. Then\, update the next and previous references of the surroundi
	ng nodes to remove the node from the list\, and decrement the size variable
	.\n	* Implement the size() method by returning the size variable.\n	* Imple
	ment any other methods specified by the List interface.\n	* Test all method
	s of MyLinkedList\n\nTASK EVALUATION:\nThe task at hand involves using GitH
	ub\, committing more than 10 times\, documenting code\, and a final defense
	. The evaluation for this task will be based on the following criteria:\n\n
		*\nGITHUB USAGE (10%): The usage of GitHub will be evaluated based on how 
	well the user is able to use GitHub for version control.\n\n	*\nCOMMITS (20
	%): The user will be evaluated based on the number of commits made to the p
	roject. A minimum of 30 commits is required to receive any points in this c
	ategory. However\, the quality and relevance of the commits will also be ev
	aluated. Commits should be made at regular intervals and should reflect sig
	nificant changes in the code.\n\n	*\nDOCUMENTING CODE (20%): The user will 
	be evaluated on their ability to document their code. Documentation should 
	include comments in the code\, a README file\, and any other relevant docum
	entation. The documentation should be clear\, concise\, and easy to underst
	and.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:PSYCHOLOGY COURSE RESEARCH DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR MID-TERM:\n\
	nYou need to prepare a detailed research design by choosing any topic (you 
	can find a list of topics in the SYLLABUS [1]) that you think is important 
	from a psychological point of view and is suitable for psychological resear
	ch. While preparing this RECOMMENDATION\, which will constitute your MID-TE
	RM tasks\, you must strictly adhere to and pay attention to the following p
	oints.\n\n1. Topic and Relevance. The subject you choose should be clearly 
	defined and explained. You should provide at least 3 reasons why you chose 
	this topic.\n\n2. Research question. You should formulate a research proble
	m in relation to the topic. While doing this\, you should also formulate th
	e meaning and scope of the problem\, the problem statement and\, if any\, s
	ub-problems.\n\n3. The goal/purpose of your research.\n\n4. Tasks of the re
	search.\n\n5. Your main and (if any) sub-hypotheses related to your researc
	h.\n\n6. Object of the research.\n\n7. Interpretation of the concepts of th
	e research.\n\n8. And finally\, you should choose the method that you will 
	use when conducting your research (it can be a psychological test or a surv
	ey that you will create yourself).\n\nIf you choose the survey method\, the
	n you need to make at least 10 questions (questions do not include: gender\
	, age\, name\, etc.).\n\nNOTE: While preparing your Individual project\, it
	 will be of great benefit to you to print out this text and put it in front
	 of you and act according to the order here. It will not be possible for th
	e assignments prepared without following the systematic here to receive hig
	h grades.\n\nYou must prepare a research proposal of at least 5 and at most
	 10 pages\, provided that it is written on a computer in accordance with th
	e above-mentioned conditions. (All assignments should have a cover and cont
	ain your own information\, page numbers should be added\, pages should be s
	tapled. 12 points and 1.5 line spacing should be followed in the writing fo
	rmat\; the grades of those who use large font size or high line spacing wil
	l be broken in order to increase the number of pages.) Your assignment shou
	ld be made in the form of a presentation (at least 5 slides) that you will 
	have to defend for 4 minutes individually.\n\nASSIGNMENTS SHOULD BE GIVEN A
	T THE PRACTICE SESSIONS (WEEK 5).\n\n\n\nLinks:\n------\n[1] https://moodle
